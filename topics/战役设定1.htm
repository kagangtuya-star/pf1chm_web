single creature within 30 feet. The attack deals 8d6 points of sonic damage, 
renders the target confused for 1d4 rounds, and leaves the target unable to 
communicate in any spoken or written language for a number of hours equal to

following adjustments to the solar sorcerer. Replace the bonus spell gained at 
3rd level with faerie fire. When the cleansing flame ability would remove a 
condition that resulted from a failed saving throw, the condition removal is not 
automatic. The target may attempt another saving throw against the effect. If 
this saving throw succeeds, the effect is removed.<BR>　　<STRONG>第29页——</STRONG>A

saddle cavalier's challenge with the following, taken from the last few 
sentences of the listed challenge ability: "The cavalier gains a +1 dodge bonus 
to AC against attacks of opportunity while charging the target of her challenge. 
This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. If the cavalier 
already has the Ride-By Attack feat, this dodge bonus increases by 
2."<BR>　　<STRONG>第60页——</STRONG>When using the genie-touched companion feat to

companion's steadfast ability grants a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against 
mind-affecting and fear effects rather than a +4 bonus.<BR><BR>
