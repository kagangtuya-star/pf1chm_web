target=_blank>D20PFSRD</A><BR><BR>Duskwalkers are tall, bipedal, gray-skinned 
beings that are incarnated from souls that have earned the honor of a second 
life. The souls that become duskwalkers have often distinguished themselves in 
the eyes of psychopomps as guardians of the cycle of birth and death. Other than 
their gray skin, their physical features bear some resemblance to those they 
held in their previous lives. As such, a typical duskwalker looks mostly human, 
other than her unusual coloration. However, duskwalkers whose ancestors belonged 
to other races can manifest with characteristic features such as pointed ears, 
hairy feet, or even feathers, horns, scales, or tails—though they rarely 
manifest smaller or larger than Medium.<BR><BR>The first duskwalkers appeared as 
the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps: an olethros mother and 
a yamaraj. The olethros mother made the case to allow certain souls whose 
actions helped preserve and protect the cycle of souls, but whose lives had been 
cut short of what fate had decreed for them to reincarnate once before passing 
to their final judgment. After a long debate, the yamaraj agreed but imposed a 
strict limit on the number of duskwalkers that can exist at one time. Whenever 
this limit has been reached, dead duskwalkers cannot be restored to life. Most 
duskwalkers accept this limitation and appreciate that the end of their lives 
opens the door for new lives to begin. Some request that those mourning their 
deaths also celebrate the birth of a new duskwalker in the near future. The 
length of time it takes for a new duskwalker to be born when one dies varies, 
but is rarely more than a year.<BR><BR>When a duskwalker is born, she appears 
spontaneously in a sanctified place with a connection to death, most often a 
graveyard or a temple. Duskwalkers do not experience infancy, instead beginning 
their lives with the appearance and facilities of a roughly 8-year-old human 
child. These mysterious children always appear cloaked in simple white robes, 
with a small satchel of food and water by their sides.<BR><BR>Duskwalker 
children mature at a variable rate depending upon the support they receive. A 
child adopted into a nurturing family or taken into care at a temple matures at 
a rate similar to that of a human child and develops a healthy balance between 
her appreciation for life and her interest in death. While duskwalker children 
almost always appear near settlements, the unusual circumstances of their 
creation sometimes lead them to be ostracized to the point where they are forced 
to fend for themselves. Duskwalker children who endure such circumstances reach 
physical and intellectual maturity rapidly, but they struggle socially and 
emotionally.<BR><BR>Duskwalker naming conventions are varied. Many duskwalkers 
prefer to select their own names shortly after they manifest. Duskwalkers who 
have a good relationship with their surrounding community choose names that 
follow that community’s traditions. Isolated duskwalkers make up their own 
conventions, naming themselves after their accomplishments or values or even 
just selecting a string of syllables that sounds nice to them.<BR><BR>Because 
duskwalkers are so rare, the few duskwalker communities that exist are small and 
form mostly among individuals united by a common goal, such as adventuring bands 
of undead-hunters. Many duskwalkers go their entire lives without meeting 
another member of their race. Instead, they usually live among whichever races 
are most common near the graveyards in which they manifested. Duskwalkers meet 
with mixed reactions from human communities. Some people look askance at their 
ashen appearance and the manner of their creation. Others find the way in which 
duskwalkers relate to death unsettling.<BR><BR>Duskwalkers struggle to 
understand the fear and hesitance with which most other races speak of death, 
and even cheerful duskwalkers tend toward dark and morbid senses of humor. 
However, other communities value or even revere duskwalkers for their wisdom, 
skill at medicine, and proficiency at fighting undead. Duskwalkers get along 
particularly well with members of other races that share a planar heritage, such 
as aasimars, aphorites, ganzis, and tieflings, but they share a mutual distrust 
with dhampirs.<BR><BR>Despite the prejudices they sometimes face, duskwalkers 
are typically companionable, open-minded, and accepting of people.<BR><BR>They 
seek friendships and romantic relationships with others of many different races. 
Many duskwalkers seek to build a family with children at some point in their 
lives.<BR><BR>They grow their families by adopting children from their 
communities, with a particular preference toward children that other prospective 
parents may look over. Most have no interest in sexual relationships, though, 
and no duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological 
children.<BR><BR>Duskwalkers are typically neutral in their alignment, like 
psychopomps themselves. Those who are not neutrally aligned tend toward good 
alignments over evil ones.<BR><BR>Members of a growing contingent of evil 
duskwalkers have been rejecting their inborn nature entirely, throwing in their 
lot with the sahkils, who delight in such perversion. These duskwalkers can lose 
the abilities that help them combat undead and gain powers better suited to 
inflicting fear, but such choices also have a chance of altering their ward 
against corruption in a particularly unsettling way. Such duskwalkers inevitably 
find that not only can they become undead, but that their deaths all but 
guarantee some form of unnatural unlife after death, often coming back as a 
ghost without such an entity’s classic inability to travel far from the place of 
its death.<BR><BR><SPAN class=bbc_color style="COLOR: orange"><STRONG><SPAN
